Rscript Step1_Preprocessing.R /wynton/home/srivastava/franceskoback/SRA_Analysis/filtered_feature_bc_matrix /wynton/home/srivastava/franceskoback/SRA_Analysis/data/AggrSheet.csv /wynton/home/srivastava/franceskoback/SRA_Analysis/data/regev_lab_cell_cycle_genes.txt /wynton/home/srivastava/franceskoback/SRA_Analysis/data/noFilters_scoresAdded.rds

Or, if you want to submit as a job, run a bash file, such as qsub -m ea -M frances.koback@gladstone.ucsf.edu myscript.sh
